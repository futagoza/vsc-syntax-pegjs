An extension for VS Code that provides syntax highlighting for PEG.js and some of its variants.

# features

- __.peg-grammar__ for PEG.js grammar files that don't do syntax highlighting for initializer blocks.
- __.pegjs__ for grammar files with JavaScript (ES6+) based initializer blocks.
- __.pegcoffee__ for grammar files with CoffeeScript based initializer blocks.

# about

The orignal syntax template was based on [https://github.com/SrTobi/code-pegjs-language](https://github.com/SrTobi/code-pegjs-language) by [Tobias Kahlert](https://github.com/SrTobi), but after the initial draft (not to mention learning more about VS Code Extensions and the Visual Studio Marketplace ðŸ˜„) I rewrote it and added more syntax templates, based on:
