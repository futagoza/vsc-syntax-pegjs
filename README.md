An extension for VS Code that provides syntax highlighting for PEG.js and some of its variants.

# languages

- __.peg-grammar__ for PEG.js grammar files that don't do syntax highlighting for initializer blocks.
- __.pegjs__ for grammar files with JavaScript (ES6+) based initializer blocks.
- __.pegcoffee__ for grammar files with CoffeeScript based initializer blocks.

[PEG.js](https://github.com/pegjs/pegjs) is developed by [David Majda](https://majda.cz/)<br />
The orignal syntax template is based on [https://github.com/SrTobi/code-pegjs-language](https://github.com/SrTobi/code-pegjs-language)<br />
I rewrote the syntax templates based on [Sublime-Babel-VSCode](https://github.com/joshpeng/Sublime-Babel-VSCode)

The rest is [me](https://github.com/futagoza) ;)
